[GERMAN VERSION]

# What is Belegarth?

[Belegarth](https://www.belegarth.com) is a medieval reenactment battle game, focusing on recreating the
speed and intensity of real battles. Our focus on safety allows
full-speed, full-contact fighting, the closest you will get to the intensity of being on a medieval battle field. It is open 
to all adults above 18, regardless of skills or previous experience. There are no fixed styles or moves, 
but plenty to learn.

## The three pillars of Belegarth

Belegarth rules are designed to be

1. Safe
We pad the weapons, not the people. The weapons are not steel, not latex, but 5 cm of closed-cell foam over a
fiberglass rod. You can hit people full force with these and leave no more than a bruise at the very worst. This
means anyone can come in, borrow a sword, start fighting, and never hold back!

2. Playable
The rules are made to work in large battles where you can't stop all the time to figure out what has happened. No levels,
no magic, no classes, just you and your skills. One hit on your body, you're dead. Lose two limbs, you're dead.
Armor absorbs one hit in each area, where it covers. Rules so simple, you can remember them even when the enemy
turns against your flanking manoeuvre and bears down on you.

3. Realistic
We strive to make battles as close to historic battles as possible within the confines of being safe and playable. 
Wearing realistic garb, armor, and insignia gives the game a special feel. While not required, it is highly encouraged
to dress the part, whether as a proud Roman, a frothing Viking, or even an Elf out of Middle-Earth. The choice is yours,
as long as it doesn't interfere with safety and playability. But even the fanciest garb does not impart special abilities -- good fighting skill is learned, not bought.
