# The rules of Belegarth

This is a simplified overview of the rules. The full rule set can be found at [belegarth.com](http://belegarth.com/rules.php)

## Target Areas and hits
	
**Head**: Do not hit. NO effect

**Torso**: One hit will kill. 

**Arms & Legs**: First hit disables the limb - disabled arms go behind the back, with a disabled leg you kneel down on the ground.
Second hit on a limb will kill.

**Hand & Feet**: No effect for hands holding something or feet on the ground, otherwise counts as arm or leg.

## Armor

Armor protects a certain area of the body against ONE hit. 
e.g.: A person wearing a chain mail or leather mail on its torso will not die when hit. 
However a second hit on the torso, regardless of the exact area will kill him. One piece of armor can cover multiple parts
of the body, and hits count separately for each part.

## Special weapons 

Apart from regular one-handed weapons, some are color-coded to indicate their differences:

**Two-handed weapons (red)**: A hit with a two-handed weapon ignores the Armor and counts as a hit to the body part. 
Two hard blows with a two-handed weapon on a shield will destroy the shield.

**Arrows**: Arrows ignore armor. Arrows may hit the head, which counts as a kill unless the arrow hits a helmeted part. 
Arrows can only be blocked by shields.

**Stabbing (green)**: Spears and other weapons with an appropriate padding can be used to stab. A single-handed stab cannot go through armor.
A two-handed stab ignores armor.

**Javelins (yellow)**: Javelins are throwing-only weapons that, like arrows, can hit in the head and ignore armor, but unlike arrows they can be
deflected by weapons or grabbed in flight.
