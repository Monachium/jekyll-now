# Weapons of all kinds

Weapons need to be safe and sturdy, but that doesn't mean they have to be difficult to make. In fact, the first
commercially available Belegarth weapons didn't make their appearance until the sport had existed for 20 years.
A number of instructions on how to make weapons can be found on the Belegarth web page.

## Swords

These are the "core" weapons, and we always have a selection available. We occasionally make mass purchases from
[Forged Foam](http://www.forgedfoam.com/) in the US, but the freight and import toll add up. These are also 
the most heavily used items, so good construction matters. A well-built sword can last for years of weekly practice,
a poor one breaks after just a few hours. 

## Axes and Flails

These add not just a different look, but also have their own strengths and weaknesses compared to swords.

## Spears, halberds, javelins, etc

Fun to use, especially in larger groups, these weapons are also fairly simple to make.

## Bow and arrow

Bows must be authentic-looking (i.e., wooden, not composite) and have a maximum draw of 35 pounds at 28 inches 
(the standard arrow length). [TDH Bogensport in Westend](http://www.tdh-bogensport.de/) has a large selection starting
at â‚¬100 - make sure to peruse their catalog, as they only have a small number of bows in the shop.

The bow and arrow is the most dangerous weapon on the field, not just in terms of in-game kills, but also when it 
comes to injuries. Both the bow and the arrow nock are pointy and could hit somebody in an eye if we're not careful. 
For that reason, we generally don't let rank beginners use the bow.

# Protective equipment

There are plenty of tutorials on how to make armor on the web, and a large number of shops sell applicable armor. 
Some commercial armor does not conform to our standards, though, so read the armor rules carefully, or ask a veteran.

## Armor
With Armor (Green Tags) we mean all items that are associated with authentic Armor pieces that would protect one
against damage from Weapons, such as Shields, Chain Mails or Leather armor. These Items are more closely discussed.

Wearing armor is not a requirement for fighting, but a personal choice.

### Leather armor

A favorite of many, as it is very malleable, easy to work with, and can be painted as well. It's is also quite light 
compared to chain mail and plate mail, but doesn't breathe as well as chain mail.

Leather armor needs to be at least 5 mm thick, which is thicker than most commercially sold armor. You can achieve this 
by layering thinner pieces of leather.

### Chain mail
Good-looking though somewhat heavy, chain mail is a favorite armor, not least because it is flexible and allows the body
to breathe.
These instructables will help making it easier to make your own:

http://www.instructables.com/id/European-4-in-1-maille-chainmail-speedweaving/ - how to weave simple 4-in-1 (they don't show it here, but it's easier to make a lot of 4-in-1's first, then make the chains by combining those)

http://www.instructables.com/id/EUROPEAN-6-IN-1-CHAIN-MAIL-BEGINNERS-GUIDE/ - harder to make, but much more solid 6-in-1 mail 

http://www.instructables.com/id/Riveted-Maille-from-Scratch/ - for the serious chain-mailer: Riveted mail!

### Plate armor
Few people make their own plate armor, but there is a wide selection available online and at medieval markets. 
Be careful to get period materials (stainless steel allowed, though), and read the rules on proper rounding of 
the corners and edges.

## Protection
With protection (Lilac Tags) we associate any protection for you body from falls, hits and other injuries that 
could occur during the game. Such protections are:

Knee pads
Gloves
Sturdy Shoes
We recommend having this kind of protection, if you are coming more often.

## Garb

Garb is a term used for garments that fit into the time frame of middle ages. Again it is a personal choice 
wearing it. We have people coming in all kinds of outfit, just make sure it can get dirty. Garb does not change the
combat, but makes it look a lot better:

## Shields 
These are easy to make once you find the right foam, and strap shields are best made according to the 
user's arm dimensions. Instructions for a basic 2 foot round shield are here. You can use layers of camping 
pad foam, or buy larger quantities of commercial-strength Stratocell from Wetropa MST GmbH.
